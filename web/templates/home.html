    <h1>What is Ransomware?</h1>
    <p>
        Ransomware is a type of malicious software designed to block access to a computer system or data until a ransom is paid. It typically encrypts the victim's data, making it inaccessible, and displays a message demanding payment in exchange for the decryption key.
    </p>

    <h2>How Does Ransomware Work?</h2>
    <p>
        Ransomware often spreads through phishing emails, malicious websites, or infected software downloads. Once it infects a system, it begins encrypting files and displays a ransom note, warning the user to pay a specific amount—usually in cryptocurrency—to regain access to their data.
    </p>

    <h2>Types of Ransomware</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Crypto Ransomware:</strong> Encrypts files and demands a ransom for the decryption key.</li>
        <li><strong>Locker Ransomware:</strong> Locks the user out of their device entirely, rendering it unusable.</li>
        <li><strong>Scareware:</strong> Pretends to be a legitimate warning but demands payment to fix non-existent problems.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to Protect Yourself?</h2>
    <p>
        Protecting against ransomware requires proactive measures, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Regularly backing up important data and storing it offline or in the cloud.</li>
        <li>Keeping your software and operating system up-to-date.</li>
        <li>Avoiding clicking on suspicious links or downloading attachments from unknown sources.</li>
        <li>Installing and maintaining reliable antivirus and anti-malware software.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What to Do if Infected?</h2>
    <p>
        If your system is infected with ransomware:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Do not pay the ransom—it doesn’t guarantee data recovery and encourages attackers.</li>
        <li>Disconnect your device from the network to prevent further spread.</li>
        <li>Seek help from cybersecurity professionals or law enforcement.</li>
        <li>Restore your data from a backup, if available.</li>
    </ul>
